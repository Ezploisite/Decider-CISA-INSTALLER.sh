# Install documentation for Decider's AUTO installer.sh


Through the release of Decider software by the American governmental organization CISA GOV, an automatic approach is offered to categorize and map threats using the metrics of MITRE ATT&CKÂ®. This makes the process of threat classification and comprehension extremely fast and versatile. Additionally, a dedicated and highly user-friendly GUI provides an extremely resilient and scalable contextualization capability for the end-user.

To simplify and automate the Decider installation process, a first BETA script has been created, which includes a BASH installer (currently semi-automatic). This allows the user to be guided step-by-step, from the boot phase to the final Decider installation, in a simple and automatic way.

The installer has been tested on few operating systems, including:

```
Ubuntu LTS 22.04.1
Ubuntu Server 22.04.1
Ubuntu Docker 23.0.1
Kali 2022.4
```
